    <p class=normal>Vocaloid characters, often referred to as "Vocaloids," are virtual singers created using Yamaha's Vocaloid software. Each Vocaloid is associated with a specific voicebank and has a unique character design, personality, and backstory. These characters have become iconic figures in the world of music, particularly in the genres of J-pop, electronic music, and various subcultures.</p><br>

      <p class=sub_title>Who is Hatsune Miku?</p>

      <img src="hatsunemiku.jpg" alt="hm" class=left width="180" height="320"><p class=normal>
        Hatsune Miku, officially code-named CV01, is a Vocaloid software voicebank developed by Crypton Future Media and its official anthropomorphic mascot character, a 16-year-old girl with long, turquoise twintails. Miku's personification has been marketed as a virtual idol, and has performed at live virtual concerts onstage as an animated projection (rear-cast projection on a specially coated glass screen).<br><br>

Hatsune Miku was the first Vocaloid developed by Crypton Future Media after they handled the release of the Yamaha vocal Meiko and Kaito. Miku was intended to be the first of a series of Vocaloids called the "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated "CV Series"), which included Kagamine Rin/Len and Megurine Luka. Each had a particular concept and vocal direction.<br><br>

She was built using Yamaha's Vocaloid 2 technology, and later updated to newer engine versions. She was created by taking vocal samples from voice actress Saki Fujita at a controlled pitch and tone. Those samples all contain a single Japanese phonic that, when strung together, creates full lyrics and phrases. The pitch of the samples was to be altered by the synthesizer engine and constructed into a keyboard-style instrument within the Vocaloid software.</p><br><br>

     <p class=sub_title>Other Characters:</p>
     <p class=name>Kagamine Rin & Kagamine Len</p>
     <p class=normal><img src="rinlen.jpeg" alt="rinl" class=right>
       Kagamine Rin & Len (鏡音リン・レン), codenamed CV02, were originally Japanese VOCALOIDs developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc., and were initially released in December 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine. They are the second set of vocals for Crypton's Character Vocal Series and were both Character Voice VOCALOIDs. There has since been 3 other installments for VOCALOID, with their final release being Kagamine Rin/Len V4x.Their voices are provided by the Japanese voice actress, stage actress, and singer Asami Shimoda (下田麻美 Shimoda Asami). According to Asami, Len's voice was achieved by singing within her chest, while Rin's was achieved by singing at the top of her head.<br><br>

       The development of the Kagamines began when Crypton formulated the concept of making a pair of female and male voicebanks. The first idea was for two voices of a girl and an identical male of the opposite gender, just like twins.Crypton originally had the intention of distributing them as twins, but this was not adopted. Crypton stated that they approved of the many different interpretations of Rin and Len's relationship that they saw in different works. Crypton's final announcement was that the Kagamines were neither siblings nor lovers. During their Append's production, Wataru Sasaki (aka. Wat) described them as two bodies with one soul. Wat also said that the Append boxart makes the pair seem like twins, due to the foetal position they were in.</p><br><br>
