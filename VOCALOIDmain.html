      <p class=title>WELCOME TO HOW TO VOCALOID!</p>
      <div class=textbox>
      <p class=sub_title>What is Vocaloid?</p>
      <p class=normal>Vocaloid (ボーカロイド, Bōkaroido) is a singing voice synthesizer software product. Its signal processing part was developed through a joint research project between Yamaha Corporation and the Music Technology Group in Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. The software was ultimately developed into the commercial product "Vocaloid" that was released in 2004.<br><br>

The software enables users to synthesize "singing" by typing in lyrics and melody and also "speech" by typing in the script of the required words. It uses synthesizing technology with specially recorded vocals of voice actors or singers. To create a song, the user must input the melody and lyrics. A piano roll type interface is used to input the melody and the lyrics can be entered on each note. The software can change the stress of the pronunciations, add effects such as vibrato, or change the dynamics and tone of the voice.<br><br>

      <p class=sub_title>How does Vocaloid work?</p>

      <iframe class=right width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAtVGHl1AFM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class=normal>Firstly,The core of Vocaloid is the "voicebank," which contains a collection of vocal samples. These samples are recorded by human singers who provide various phonetic sounds, pitches, and dynamics.
Each voicebank represents a different character or "Vocaloid," such as Hatsune Miku or Megurine Luka, with a unique vocal tone and personality.<br><br>

Then, Users input lyrics into the Vocaloid software, typing the words they want the Vocaloid to sing. The software uses a phonetic system to convert the text into the appropriate phonemes (the smallest units of sound in speech). Users also create a melody by inputting notes on a piano roll interface, similar to those found in digital audio workstations (DAWs). The melody defines the pitch and timing of each note.<br><br>

After that, The Vocaloid engine combines the phonetic information from the text with the pitch and timing information from the melody. It then selects and manipulates the appropriate vocal samples from the voicebank to match the desired sound. The engine adjusts the pitch, dynamics, and expression of the samples to create a natural-sounding vocal performance.<br><br>

Once everything is set up, users can further refine the vocal performance by adjusting parameters like vibrato, pitch bends, dynamics, and breathiness.
Vocaloid also allows the application of effects like reverb, chorus, and EQ to enhance the sound. Once the vocal performance is complete, it can be exported as an audio file and used in music production.<br><br>
